# Tandm 🕰️💵

**A calendar that respects both your time *and* your money.**  

Tandm helps **adults adulting** and **parents parenting** manage their schedules and budgets in one place — reducing stress and wasted effort.

## 🌟 Vision

Most tools separate calendars and budgets, but life doesn’t work that way. Every event has a time cost *and* often a money cost. Tandm bridges that gap so people can focus less on juggling tools and more on living life.

## 🎯 Scope

### Who it’s for
- **Adults adulting** → Busy professionals balancing work, errands, bills, and personal commitments.  
- **Parents parenting** → Families coordinating school, sports, childcare, and household budgets who need clarity and calm.  

### What it does (MVP)
- Combine **scheduling** and **spending** into one simple, repeatable system.  
- Make it easy to see the **real cost of events** (time + money).  
- Support **routines** that reduce the mental overhead of re-planning and re-budgeting.  

### What it won’t do (yet)
- Replace full-featured accounting or finance apps (like YNAB, Mint, or QuickBooks).  
- Replace enterprise scheduling platforms.  
- Automate every detail of life.  

### Why it matters
- People waste energy switching between disconnected tools.  
- Families and individuals miss opportunities or overspend because they can’t see both sides (time & money) of their commitments.  
- Simpler, more repeatable routines lead to less stress and more intentional living.

## 🚀 Current Status

⚡ Tandm is **brand new** — this repo is mostly empty for now.  
If you’re the kind of person who wants to optimize life **throughout** and believes tools should lighten your load, **follow along and witness the journey from the very beginning**.
