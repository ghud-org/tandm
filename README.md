# Tandm ⏱️💵

**Time + Money = Throughput**

Tandm is a brand-new calendar app that helps you plan time *and* money in the same place.  
Most events cost both — why not manage both together?

## ⚠️ Early Stage

This repo is empty right now because Tandm is *that* new.  
If you’re reading this, you’re seeing the project **from day zero**.  
We’ll be documenting and building in public so you can:  

- Watch the journey unfold from the very beginning  
- Learn from the design and development decisions along the way  
- Decide if Tandm might be the right tool for you  

## 🌟 Who Tandm is for

Tandm is built for **high performers** who want to:  
- Optimize their time and money **throughout**, not just in silos  
- Turn budgeting into a repeatable routine  
- Adapt faster when life changes
