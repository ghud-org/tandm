# The Problem Statement

> _"I don’t need much from either the calendar or budgeting aspect, I just want to know what I’m doing, when, and how much it’ll cost me."_

Transient expenses are hard to track in a budget compared to fixed and variable expenses.

I follow Budget To Zero, Envelopes, 50/30/20, and I end up with a great budget on paper.

But then, I have to make a trade off: track my expenses real-time, update my budget, update my calendar, keep up with chores and errands, and find time to relax — or get enough sleep.

I wish I could track my expenses via calendar events because then my expenses are side-by-side with my calendar events, which typically cost an estimable amount of money. This would allow me to make quick and reliable judgements about my plans according to my budget for the day, week, month, etc.

I don’t need much from either the calendar or budgeting aspect, I just want to know what I’m doing, when, and how much it’ll cost me. The tricky part right now with my spreadsheet-based budget is twofold: fitting my budget into the context of my life as it’s happening and fiddling around with a spreadsheet.

## Solution design notes

### Typical calendar views

- Month
- Week
- Day

### Typical calendar events plus 'amount' and 'envelope' and 'tag' fields

- Recurring events represent fixed and variable expenses
- Non-recurring events represent transient expenses

### Budgeting view

- Given a time frame, displays the user’s income vs expenses
